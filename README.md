RouteE Compass is an energy-aware routing engine for the RouteE ecosystem of software tools with the following key features:

- Dynamic and extensible search objectives that allow customized blends of distance, time, cost, and energy (via RouteE Powertrain) at query-time
- Core engine written in Rust for improved runtimes, parallel query execution, and the ability to load nation-sized road networks into memory
- Rust, HTTP, and Python APIs for integration into different research pipelines and other software

RouteE Compass is a part of the [RouteE](https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/route-energy-prediction-model.html) family of mobility tools created at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and uses [RouteE Powertrain](https://github.com/NREL/routee-powertrain) to predict vehicle energy during the search.
