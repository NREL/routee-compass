# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**RouteE Compass** 
RouteE Compass is an energy-aware routing engine for the RouteE ecosystem of software tools with the following key features:

    - Dynamic and extensible search objectives that allow customized blends of distance, time, cost, and energy (via RouteE Powertrain) at query-time
    - Core engine written in Rust for improved runtimes, parallel query execution, and the ability to load nation-sized road networks into memory
    - Rust and Python APIs for integration into different research pipelines and other software

## Component-Specific Guidance

**For Rust core development**:
- All core rust code is in `rust/`

**For Python Wrapper development**:
- Package is managed with matruin and pyproject.toml and uses PyO3 bindings
- Development setup: `conda activate routee-compass && matruin develop` from root directory

## Quick Start Commands

### Core Operations
```bash
cd rust 

# Build 
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```

### Python Wrapper Operations
```bash
# activate environment
conda activate routee-compass

# build source
maturin develop

# testing
pytest tests/
```
