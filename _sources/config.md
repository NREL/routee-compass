# App Config

Each `CompassApp` instance is defined by a configuration toml file.
The configuration file specifies things like "Which traversal model should I use, and what are its parameters?" and "Which data sources should I use?".

If you follow the [open street maps example](notebooks/open_street_maps_example.ipynb), the code will produce a few configuration files in the `golden_co/` folder. Let's take a look at the `osm_default_energy.toml` file.
We added some annotations to describe the different sections:

```toml
# how many threads should a CompassApp use to process queries?
parallelism = 2

# the parameters for the underlying road network graph
[graph]
# a file containing all the graph edges and their adjacencies
edge_list_file = "edges-compass.csv.gz"
# a file containing all the graph verticies
vertex_list_file = "vertices-compass.csv.gz"
# if verbose is true, you'll see more information when loading the graph
verbose = true

# which traversal model to use and its parameters
[traversal]
# the speed_grade_energy_model can compute routes using time or energy as costs
type = "speed_grade_energy_model"
# what underlying machine learn framework to use [smartcore | onnx]
model_type = "smartcore"
# speeds for each edge in the graph
speed_table_file = "edges-posted-speed-enumerated.txt.gz"
# the file for the routee-powertrain model
energy_model_file = "2016_TOYOTA_Camry_4cyl_2WD.bin"
# the "best case" energy rate for this particular vehicle (something like highway mpg) that's used in the a-star algorithm
ideal_energy_rate = 0.02857142857
# the units of the above speed table
speed_table_speed_unit = "kilometers_per_hour"
# the units of what the routee-powertrain model expects speed to be in
energy_model_speed_unit = "miles_per_hour"
# the units of what the routee-powertrain model expects grade to be in
energy_model_grade_unit = "decimal"
# the units of what the routee-powertrain model outputs for energy
energy_model_energy_rate_unit = "gallons_gasoline_per_mile"
# the units of what the traversal model outputs for time
output_time_unit = "minutes"
# the units of what the traversal model outputs for distance
output_distance_unit = "miles"

# which plugins should be activated?
[plugin]

# input plugins get applied to a query before it gets executed
[[plugin.input_plugins]]
# the grid search plugin allows for multiple queries to be generated from one query with the "grid_search" key
type = "grid_search"

[[plugin.input_plugins]]
# a vertex based RTree for matching incoming x/y coordinates to a graph vertex
type = "vertex_rtree"
# a file with all the graph verticies
vertices_file = "vertices-compass.csv.gz"

# output plugs get applied to the result of running a query
[[plugin.output_plugins]]
# summarize the results of the search
type = "summary"

[[plugin.output_plugins]]
# a plugin that gathers traversal specific outputs like the route geometry
type = "traversal"
# return the full route in a geojson format
route = "geo_json"
# return the full search tree in a geojson format
tree = "geo_json"
# geometry objects for all the edges in the graph
geometry_file = "edges-geometries-enumerated.txt.gz"

[[plugin.output_plugins]]
# append an map specific id(like Open Street Maps Nodes) onto the compass verticies (which use a simple integer internal index)
type = "uuid"
# a file with ids for each vertex in the graph
uuid_file = "vertices-uuid-enumerated.txt.gz"
```

## Traversal Models

Traversal models are what the application uses when computing a path through the graph.
The models can use things like road speed to compute the shortest time route or vehicle energy consumption to compute a route that uses the least energy.
Here are the default traversal models that come with the `CompassApp`:

### Distance

The distance traversal model is a very simple model that just uses distance for computing a route, producing the route that has the shortest distance.

```toml
[traversal]
type = "distance"
distance_unit = "miles"
```

### Speed Table

The speed table traversal model uses a speed lookup table to compute the fastest (or shortest time) route.

```toml
[traversal]
type = "speed_table"
speed_table_file = "edges-posted-speed-enumerated.txt.gz"
speed_unit = "kilometers_per_hour"
output_distance_unit = "miles"
output_time_unit = "minutes"
```

### Speed Grade Energy Model

The speed grade energy model computes energy (with a routee-powertrain vehicle model) and speed over an edge. This model also takes in an additional query argument `energy_cost_coefficient` that specifies how much to value energy in the resulting cost. For example, an `energy_cost_coefficient` of `0.0` would not value energy at all and would return a pure shortest time route whereas an `energy_cost_coefficient` of `1.0` would not value time at all and would return a pure least energy route.

```toml
[traversal]
type = "speed_grade_energy_model"
model_type = "smartcore"
speed_table_file = "data/tomtom_metro_denver_network/edges-free-flow-speed-enumerated.txt.gz"
grade_table_file = "data/tomtom_metro_denver_network/edges-grade-enumerated.txt.gz"
grade_table_grade_unit = "decimal"
energy_model_file = "data/2016_TOYOTA_Camry_4cyl_2WD.bin"
ideal_energy_rate = 0.02857142857
speed_table_speed_unit = "kilometers_per_hour"
energy_model_speed_unit = "miles_per_hour"
energy_model_grade_unit = "decimal"
energy_model_energy_rate_unit = "gallons_gasoline_per_mile"
output_time_unit = "minutes"
output_distance_unit = "miles"
```

## Plugins

Input and output plugins are used to modify the queries and the results respectively.
Both queries and results are valid json objects and so a plugin takes in a json object and returns a json object.

## Input Plugins

Here are the default input plugins that are provided:

### Grid Search

The grid search plugin allows you to specify a `grid_search` key in the query and it will generate multiple queries from those parameters. For example, if you had a query:

```json
{
  "origin_name": "Government Center Station",
  "destination_name": "Cannonball Creek Brewery",
  "origin_x": -105.200146,
  "origin_y": 39.72657,
  "destination_x": -105.234964,
  "destination_y": 39.768477,
  "grid_search": {
    "energy_cost_coefficient": [0.0, 1.0]
  }
}
```

The grid search plugin would take this single query and generate two queries that would be fed into the application:

```json
[
  {
    "origin_name": "Government Center Station",
    "destination_name": "Cannonball Creek Brewery",
    "origin_x": -105.200146,
    "origin_y": 39.72657,
    "destination_x": -105.234964,
    "destination_y": 39.768477,
    "energy_cost_coefficient": 0.0
  },
  {
    "origin_name": "Government Center Station",
    "destination_name": "Cannonball Creek Brewery",
    "origin_x": -105.200146,
    "origin_y": 39.72657,
    "destination_x": -105.234964,
    "destination_y": 39.768477,
    "energy_cost_coefficient": 1.0
  }
]
```

#### Config

```toml
[[plugin.input_plugins]]
type = "grid_search"
```

### Vertex RTree

The vertex RTree plugin uses an RTree to match coordiantes to graph verticies.

For example, if you specify your query origin and destination as lat/lon coordinates (i.e. `origin_x`, `origin_y`) we need a way to match this to the graph and then insert an `origin_vertex` or a `destination_vertex` into the query. Those two fields are what the application expects when conducting a search.

#### Config

```toml
[[plugin.input_plugins]]
type = "vertex_rtree"
vertices_file = "vertices-compass.csv.gz"
```

## Output Plugins

Here are the default output plugins that are provided:

### Summary

A plugin adds a simple `traversal_summary` section to the result.

```toml
[[plugin.output_plugins]]
type = "summary"
```

### Traversal

A plugin that appends various items to the result.

#### Config

```toml
[[plugin.output_plugins]]
type = "traversal"
route = "geo_json"
tree = "geo_json"
geometry_file = "edges-geometries-enumerated.txt.gz"
```

The `route` key will add route information to the result depending on the type.
The `tree` key will add search tree information to the result depending on the type (be aware that this could be very large for searches that span a large geographical distance).

Both the `route` and the `tree` key are optional and if omitted, the plugin will not append anything for it. In addition both keys can be specified in the following formats:

- "json": non-geometry output writing traversal metrics (cost, state) as JSON for a route or a tree
- "wkt": outputs a LINESTRING for a route, or a MULTILINESTRING for a tree
- "geo_json": annotated geometry data as a FeatureCollection of LineStrings with properties assigned from traversal metrics
