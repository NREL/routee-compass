    "RouteE Compass can execute search plans for internal combustion (ICE), plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and battery electric (BEV) powertrain types. \n",
    "Each of these powertrain types are represented by RouteE Powertrain models.\n",
    "To see all the models we can use you can take a look at the folder `denver_co/models` and then reference the `traversal.vehicles` section of the `osm_default_energy.toml` configuration file to see how they are integrated and what name is expected as the `model_name` parameter in the query.\n",
    "Note that you can also train your own RouteE Powertrain models.\n",
    "Take a look at [this notebook](https://github.com/NREL/routee-powertrain/blob/main/docs/model_training-smartcore.ipynb) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate running other powertrain types, we'll use an ICE (2016_TOYOTA_Camry_4cyl_2WD), a BEV (2017_CHEVROLET_Bolt) and a PHEV (2016_CHEVROLET_Volt) model and create queries for each powertrain type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we can specify the `starting_soc_percent` for any vehicle that uses electric energy (BEV and PHEV).\n",
    "Also notice that we specify the energy weights for both \"electric\" and \"liquid\" energy that get applied to both energy sources.\n",
    "In the cases of the ICE and BEV, we only use one type of energy (liquid and electric respectively). \n",
    "But, for the PHEV model, we use a combination of liquid and electric energy.\n",
    "By default, the PHEV will run using battery energy exclusively (starting at `starting_soc_percent`) and when the battery runs out, the vehicle will switch to it's hybrid mode, using primarily gasoline energy."
