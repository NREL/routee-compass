# Charging Stations Example

In this example, we'll demonstrate how to use RouteE Compass to plan routes 
that incorporate charging stations for electric vehicles.

This builds off the [Open Street Maps Example](01_open_street_maps_example) 
and assumes that we've already downloaded a road network and charging station data, 
so be sure to check that one out first.

## Low State of Charge Scenario

Next, we'll create a scenario where the vehicle has a low starting state of charge (SOC) 
and needs to find a charging station along the route.

Note that we'll allow both DC Fast Charging (DCFC) and Level 2 (L2) charging stations
but we're also trying to minimize the trip time, so the algorithm should prioritize 
DCFC charging stations since they provide faster charging.
