# OpenStreetMap Example

In this example, we download a road network from OSM using the OSMNx package, and then process the result, resulting in a RouteE Compass network dataset.

## requirements

To download an open street maps dataset, we'll need some extra dependnecies which are included with the conda distribution of this pacakge:

```console
conda create -n routee-compass -c conda-forge python=3.11 nrel.routee.compass
```
"""

from nrel.routee.compass.plot import plot_route_folium, plot_routes_folium
# %%

"""
## Building RouteE Compass Dataset

### Get OSM graph

First, we need to get an OSM graph that we can use to convert into the format RouteE Compass expects.

In this example we will load in a road network that covers Golden, Colorado as a small example, but this workflow will work with any osmnx graph (osmnx provides [many graph download operations](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-reference.html#module-osmnx.graph)).
"""

# %%
g = ox.graph_from_place("Denver, Colorado, USA", network_type="drive")
# %%


"""
### Convert Graph to Compass Dataset

Now, we call the `generate_compass_dataset` function which will convert the osmnx graph into files that are compatible with RouteE Compass.

```{note}
In order to get the most accurate energy results from the routee-powertrain vehicle models, it's important to include road grade information since it plays a large factor in vehicle energy consumption.
That being said, adding grade can be a big lift computationally. In our case, we pull digital elevation model (DEM) raster files from USGS and then use osmnx to append elevation and grade to the graph. If the graph is large, this can take a while to download and could take up a lot of disk space.
So, we recommend that you include grade information in your graph but want to be clear about the requirements for doing so.

If you do not wish to impute grade from node elevations, remove "grade" from the "phases" argument.
```
"""

# %%
generate_compass_dataset(g, output_directory="denver_co")
# %%


"""
This will parse the OSM graph and write the RouteE Compass files into a new folder "denver_co/". If you take a look in this directory, you'll notice some `.toml` files like: `osm_default_energy.toml`.
These are configurations for the compass application. Take a look [here](https://nrel.github.io/routee-compass/config.html) for more information about this file.

## Running

### Load Application

Now we can load the application from one of our config files.
We'll pick `osm_default_energy.toml` for computing energy optimal routes.
"""

# %%
app = CompassApp.from_config_file("denver_co/osm_default_energy.toml")
# %%


"""
###  Queries

With our application loaded we can start computing routes by passing queries to the app.
To demonstrate, we'll route between two locations in Denver, CO utilzing the grid search input plugin to run three separate searches.

The `model_name` is the vehicle we want to use for the route. If you look in the folder `denver_co/models` you'll see a collection of routee-powertrain models that can be used to compute the energy for your query.

The `vehicle_state_variable_rates` section defines rates to be applied to each component of the cost function. In this case we use the following costs:

 - 0.655 dollars per mile
 - 20 dollars per hour (or 0.333 dollars per minute)
 - 3 dollars per gallon of gas

The `grid_search` section defines our test cases.
Here, we have three cases: [`least_time`, `least_energy`, `least_cost`].
In the least_time and least_energy cases, we zero out all other variable contributions using the `state_variable_coefficients` which always get applied to each cost componenet.
In the least_cost case, we allow each cost component to contribute equally and the algorithm will minimize the resulting cost from all components being added together (after getting multiplied by the appropriate `vehicle_state_variable_rate`.
